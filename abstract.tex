Data integration and data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes are procedures for creating data warehouses (DW). However, ETL processes and data integration are usually developed for data structured by relational models, which represent only a small part of the data maintained by many companies. In this way, there is a growing demand to extract, transform, and load structured data from non relational data models and load them into a unified data repository. However, due to the complexity of the data models, there are several challenges for an extraction, transformation and loading of data organized by non relational models, requirements, specific characteristics, such as heterogeneity and distribution of data, in an environment of extraction, transformation and data loading.
In addition, many companies are struggling to deal with ETL tools available in the market, often because of the need to integrate ETL tools with legacy systems. Learning how to handle these tools can be very costly in terms of time and financially, and so many companies end up opting to develop their processes using a general purpose programming language.
Therefore, we propose ETL4NoSQL, a programmable, flexible framework and integration to help, model and execute ETL processes, which enables structured data extraction, transformation and loading in non relational data models. We present the components of the ETL4NoSQL framework, as well as its interfaces and functionalities. In addition, we conducted an experimental software study, which aimed to verify if ETL4NoSQL is suitable to assist in any development of ETL processes. The study consisted of the analysis of ETL tools found in the literature, with the purpose of characterizing them through the intersection of their functionalities in the comparative context between them. Finally, we propose an ETL implementation environment that allows the reuse and extension of ETL4NoSQL programming interfaces for ETL development applications, using two different types of NoSQL DBMSs.
